# Ask me absolutely nothing!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

I get a lot of questions by email. I often don't reply. This way I have a repo that everyone can see that I also don't reply.

Abolutely nothing means *abolutely nothing*. Personal questions, nope. Money, nope. Work, nope. Life, nope. Code, nope. Whatever, nope.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered (pretty much an assurance)
- Use such a succinct title and description that it's practially, if not *actually*, empty.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
